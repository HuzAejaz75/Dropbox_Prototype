\f0\fs24 \cf0 kahan hum aur kahan wo., nafs ki zulmaniyat se gum hogaya aur wahan par pura control maujood hai.sometimes we feel the light of our soul\
e philosopher ne kaha tha " agar tum ye chahtey ho ke tumhe bhi naware rabbani se interaction ko ho...to apni tanhaiyon may ... " do you wish that you want to meet God, then in your lonliness reflect, think and implore may be you may find a ray of light from within you."\
so after the big bang the atoms came into existence, the equity of observation of the universe done by the scientist is amazing, freud said that there are 3 levels which is id /libido and above that self and above that it is super ego, and these are the three things nafs , kalb aur rooh. superego is imposed by soceity which is an urge from God to make man rise from his animalistic nature, and earthly desires and in betweent them is heart if the heart is taken over by id and libido then man becomes just an animal .  the first level is the wolrd of amr, then therei s the world of planet earth. in amr there is no time and soul doesnt have time, neither do angels, as they travel at the speed of light, and it is here that when angels bring a message from up high it is the soul of the prophet that recives the message from god, just like how radio signals are caught by a antenna, heart is what catches the inspiration from God. and Gabriel brings the message into the heart of the prophet. \
\
that light is what is required to be brought out. \

I could sit and writ enowm, clear my brain of all the stuff thats sticking inside and become more clean and elegant. The problem is that we have to get things done, there is so muchwork to be done, so much creatve work that needs to be done and we need to bring out our creativity and become more knowledgable and become more intelligent and over come the discease that has stuck our head and our personality, the thing is we need to go edge of tomorrow in a ballsitic manner, we need to overcome this unplanned life, as socrates said so wisely " the unexamined life is not worth living", i would like to stretch that a little and say "the unplanned life is not worth living" and therefore in my opinion life needs to be planned, you need to set goals for the day and accomplish those goals so that life can be fulfilling, the problem that I am having is that it is simple, the problem is simple, i need to get a lof of work done and i am afraid so i do not take any action at all.\
Thats the thing that needs to be done and we need to work very hard on this and start working immeadiately as this is a rare chance and every second should be utilized to the fullest. \
\
the tasks that need to be done today are:\
1. need to complete the work on the timer\
and once thats done we need to make status changes \
once thats done we need to work on the general design of the website and strecth our knowledge further more and then we can call it a wrap for the day.\
the problem is timers, i do not keep track of them and do not do a status update , therefore picturization of resistance is very important.\
\
the next task is something that needs to be done even more, which is to complete the work that needs to be done a person has only so many hours ans that guy said in that video, all you can do is all you can do...\
and how do we go about doing all that we can do?\
the thing that needs to be done here is that we need to work on this problem , what we have  to do netx is to complete the paralleling of the individual tasks and their completion within a unit time, this can be accomplished by doing something that we though about today which is using a variable such as curr wish and then we can abort a process based on the current wish , that is if the id is same then kill that process, easier said than done but thats a start on which we can work. I feel a bit uncomfrotable wiht these people hanging around here and me working here.\
There is much work to be done and very little time.\
\
The thing is we need a stopping point\
1. log in log out\
2. inidividual user login\
3. button independence and stopping ans saving of data\
4. reouting properly\
5. then once done we wil make a change every week\
1. add animals \
2. animal stuff etc\
\
next up we need to dabble in unity engine for game development using C# and android app development.\
this app is essential to my working, if i do not add somehting here every minutes then i am failing in my duties, thats th\
